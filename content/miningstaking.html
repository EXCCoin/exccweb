          ExchangeCoin (EXCC) offers two ways to earn cryptocurrency: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). To mine EXCC through PoW, all you need is a modern graphics card with at least 4GB of memory (AMD, GeForce, etc.). Our coin is ASIC resistant, meaning we give full control of the network to individuals rather than large market players. To mine EXCC, simply visit <a href="http://pool.excc.co">http://pool.excc.co</a>, download your miner, and start mining.

          For an extra layer of security, we also offer PoS, which makes 51% attacks almost impossible to perform. To stake EXCC, you must use the Exilibrium wallet or have knowledge about using cryptocurrencies via Terminal. By staking EXCC, you help to strengthen the network, benefiting everyone involved.
